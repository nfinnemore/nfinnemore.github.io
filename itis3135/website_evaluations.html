      <h3>
        <a href="https://arngren.net/">Arngren</a>
      </h3>
      <p>
          The website for an electronics company to buy their products
      </p>
      <ul>
            <li>Contrast - 
            Names are the same font color and size as descriptions, but are bolded leading to little contrast. </li>
            <li>Repitition - 
            There is very little consistency between font color usage and it seems random. </li>
            <li>Alignment - 
            Items are randomly sorted and their info boxes go over and under other items with seemingly zero alignment. </li>
            <li>Proximity - 
            Nothing is sorted near other relevant items and there are many text breaks. </li>

      </ul>
      <h3>
        <a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple</a>
      </h3>
      <p>
          Apples main website
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Contrast - 
            All the images and text pop on the white background. </li>
            <li>Repitition - 
            Color scheme of white and black is repeated on all pages with navigation bar always on the same spot. </li>
            <li>Alignment - 
            Everything is organised the same way with topics being evenly focused in the center as you scroll. </li>
            <li>Proximity - 
            Not a lot of info jammed into the page, everything is spaced out. </li>
        </ul>
