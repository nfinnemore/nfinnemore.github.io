        <h3>Why I Started the Channel</h3>
          <p>The reason I started my channel was to easily share and store the montages and memes I would make of clips while gaming with my friends. 
          Many of the views are my friends rewatching the video, and a few videos have over 100 views.
          Growing the channel was never a priority as, again, it was mainly to store the videos themselves.
          Videos take a lot of hard drive space so moving them onto youtube helped save storage while keeping them accessible made Youtube an appealing platform.
          </p>
        <h3>What Game is Being Recorded?</h3>
          <p>
          The game featured in every montage is Rainbow6 Siege by Ubisoft. It is a 5 vs 5 team based shooter game.
          We have all been playing the game for years and had tons of funny moments and regreted not recording them, so I found out about Nividia Shadowplay as an easy way to record and started making the videos.
          There have been thoughts of also recording other games, but the reason I haven't is talked about later.
          The clips featured are from many people's perspective, but mainly mine with the others weaved in here and there.
          </p>
        <h3>How come the last Video Was a Year Ago?</h3>
          <p>
          Even though I have a lot of clips saved and could make a few videos, I mainly haven't due to college.
          Working on my degree has taken a lot of time and effort, and I spend my freetime mostly playing the games instead of editing videos of them now.
          There may be more videos, but for now they are mostly up to stagnant until I get more free time.
          </p>
          <p>I did enjoy making videos, but I am not sure how long this hiatus will be.
          Until then, enjoy the rest of the videos!
