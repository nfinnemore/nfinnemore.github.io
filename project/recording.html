      <h2>How I Record Videos</h2>
      <p>I record my videos using Nividia's Shadowplay only.</p>
      <h3>The main reasons I like to use Shadowplay are - </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>It is free and easy to install and update</li>
        <li>It has an instant replay system where I can press a button and it saves the previous minute </li>
        <li>It has ingame overlays to control recording in supported games</li>
        <li>Does not impact the performence of games while it's in the background</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I've never had any major issues while using Shadowplay.
          I would recommend any to try it if they plan on making videos.
          You can check it out <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/geforce-experience/shadowplay/">here</a> if you are interested.
