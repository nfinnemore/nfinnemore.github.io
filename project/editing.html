      <h2>How I Edit My Videos</h2>
      <p>I record my Edit using Shotcut, an open source video editing software. I mainly used it cause it was free, but it also had some nice features like</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The UI is not too complicated</li>
        <li>It accepts tons of video formats so it is easy to start editing</li>
        <li>You can edit audio and video together and play it back to test</li>
      </ul>
      <p>That's mainly it, it was free and easy to download to start using.</p>
      <p>The only issues I've had is files corrupting while moving them onto a new disk drive, which may not be the editor's issue.</p>
      <p>If you are interested in checking out more about it, you can find it on
        <a href="https://shotcut.org/">it's website</a> .
